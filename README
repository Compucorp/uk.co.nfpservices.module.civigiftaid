The extension creates 2 new custom data group (Gift Aid, Gift Aid Declaration) to hold data related to giftaid. 

Edit the settings for the 'Gift Aid' custom data group (which has the 'Eligible for Gift Aid?' field) to be used for only specific contribution types (eg. only donation)

Register the gift aid report

The Gift aid module comes with a report that can be submitted to HMRC.  You need to register this report in CiviCRM's report registry.

Go to Administer > CiviReport > Register Report.

The URL for this report should be: GiftAid/Report/Form/Contribute/GiftAid.php

The class name is: GiftAid_Report_Form_Contribute_GiftAid

A sensible title would be: Gift Aid

And a sensible description would be: For submitting Gift Aid reports to HMRC treasury.

You should add it as part of the CiviContribute component.
