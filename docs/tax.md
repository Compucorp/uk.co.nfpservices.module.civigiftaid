# Managing the basic rate of Tax
From v2.0 of the module you are now able to change the rate of tax that the module uses to calculate the Gift Aid amount reclaimable and stored in the Gift Aid amount field.

The percentage used in the calculation is now stored in an option group labelled:

*The GiftAid basic rate tax*

You can edit this by navigating to **Administer > CiviContribute > GiftAid > Gift Aid Basic Rate Tax**
 link in the admin menu.

Changing the rate of tax (shown as a percentage) will not affect past Gift Aid amounts calculated, but only the new amounts calculated when new contributions are added to a batch.
