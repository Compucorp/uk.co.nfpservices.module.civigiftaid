# The Gift Aid Declaration

On install, a "Gift Aid" profile was created for you.
If you add this to a contribution page the user can make the gift aid declaration:
![Gift Aid Declaration via profile](/images/profilegiftaid.png)

It will then appear on the contact record:
![Gift Aid Declarations on Contact Record](/images/profilegiftaid.png)

If a user creates a gift aid declaration of *Yes* or *Yes in the past 4 years* and later submits a declaration with "No" 
an end_date will be set and the declaration will be closed.

A new declaration will be created if the user submits another with *Yes*.
